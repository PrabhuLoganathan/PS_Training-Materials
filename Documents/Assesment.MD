### **Automation Task: Login Scenario Using Maven, Java, TestNG & Page Object Model**  

#### **Instructions:**  
Create a **Maven-based Java project** to automate the **login functionality** of any website of your choice using the following concepts:  

### **Project Requirements:**  

1. **Maven Project Setup**  
   - Create a Maven project and manage dependencies using `pom.xml`.  
   - Include necessary dependencies for **Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, WebDriverManager**, and **TestNG Listeners**.  

2. **Use Page Object Model (POM) with Page Factory**  
   - Design separate **Page Classes** for handling web elements and actions.  
   - Implement **Page Factory** for efficient element initialization.  

3. **TestNG Framework**  
   - Use **TestNG annotations (`@Test`, `@BeforeMethod`, `@AfterMethod`)** for structured test execution.  
   - Implement **Assertions** to validate the login functionality.  

4. **Listeners in TestNG**  
   - Implement **TestNG Listeners** to capture test execution details.  
   - Generate logs for **test pass, fail, and skip scenarios**.  

5. **Google Chrome Browser Execution**  
   - Use **WebDriverManager** to manage ChromeDriver.  
   - Ensure test execution runs smoothly on **Google Chrome**.  

### **Test Case: Login Automation Scenario**  
**Objective:** Automate the login functionality of a website.  

#### **Steps:**  
1. Open the website login page.  
2. Enter a valid username and password.  
3. Click the **Login** button.  
4. Validate successful login (e.g., check for a dashboard, welcome message, or profile section).  
5. Implement a **negative test case** to handle invalid login attempts.  

Your project should follow **best coding practices**, ensuring **reusability, maintainability, and scalability**.
