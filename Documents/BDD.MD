# 🅱️🅳🅳 - 🥒 Training

## 🏁 Introduction to 🅱️🅳🅳
⚡ Behavior-Driven Development (🅱️🅳🅳) is an 🏎️ agile software development approach that enhances 🤝 collaboration between 👨‍💻 developers, 🧪 testers, and 💼 business stakeholders. 🅱️🅳🅳 extends 🅃🄳🄳 (Test-Driven Development) by using **📜 natural language descriptions** of desired 🎯 behavior to drive development.

### **🔥 Key Aspects of 🅱️🅳🅳:**
- Encourages **🤝 collaboration** among stakeholders.
- Uses **🌍 real-world examples** to clarify 🏗️ business requirements.
- Supports **🤖 test automation** and 📜 executable specifications.
- Reduces **🤷‍♂️ misunderstandings and 🔄 rework**.
- Bridges the 🏗️ gap between 🛠️ technical and 👥 non-technical teams.

## 🔄 How 🅱️🅳🅳 Differs from 🅃🄳🄳
🅱️🅳🅳 builds upon 🅃🄳🄳 by expressing ✅ tests in a **📖 human-readable format** using structured 📜 natural language (Gherkin). This fosters better 🗣️ communication between 👨‍💻 technical and 👥 non-technical team members.

| 📌 Feature  | 🅃🄳🄳 | 🅱️🅳🅳 |
|----------|----|----|
| **🎯 Focus** | 🔍 Code correctness | 🎭 Business behavior |
| **💻 Language** | 🖥️ Programming (e.g., JUnit, NUnit) | 📜 Natural language (Gherkin) |
| **🤝 Collaboration** | 👨‍💻 Developers | 👨‍💻 Developers, 🧪 Testers, 📊 Business Analysts |
| **✅ Test Types** | 🔬 Unit tests | 🎭 Acceptance/End-to-end tests |

## 📝 🅱️🅳🅳 Example
A simple **🅱️🅳🅳 scenario using 📜 Gherkin syntax**:

```gherkin
Feature: 👤 User Login
  Scenario: ✅ Successful login
    Given the user is on the 🏠 login page
    When the user enters 🔐 valid credentials
    And clicks the 🔘 login button
    Then the user should be redirected to the 🏠 dashboard
```
